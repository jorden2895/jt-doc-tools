"""End-to-end ACL test for pdf-stamp / pdf-watermark preview endpoints (#28 pt2).

Bug: the preview-serving endpoint (`/preview/{name}`) calls
upload_owner.require(), but the endpoints that CREATE those preview files
(`/preview`, `/preview-watermarked`, ...) never called upload_owner.record().
With auth on, an authenticated non-admin who legitimately uses the tool got a
fail-secure 403 on their OWN preview (admin passed via admin-override) — so edit
mode + composite mode showed nothing, even though the final download worked.

These tests stand up a real non-admin session (role `sales`, which grants both
pdf-stamp and pdf-watermark), upload a PDF to the preview endpoint, and assert:
  - the uploader can fetch their own preview PNG        -> 200
  - a different non-admin user cannot                   -> 403 (isolation holds)
