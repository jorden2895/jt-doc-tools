"""Audit every tool router for unsafe path expressions.

CodeQL flags ~42 endpoints with `py/path-injection` ("Uncontrolled data used
in path expression"). All such call sites SHOULD be preceded by one of:

  - app.core.safe_paths.safe_join(base, user_name)
  - app.core.safe_paths.sanitize_filename(name)
  - app.core.safe_paths.is_safe_name(name)         # boolean form, then raise
  - app.core.safe_paths.require_uuid_hex(s, ...)
  - app.core.upload_owner.require(uid, request)    # ACL — rejects guessed IDs

This test is a **structural audit**: for every router file under app/tools,
parse the source and assert that any function which constructs a `Path()` /
calls `open()` / returns `FileResponse()` from a parameter named like
`filename`, `upload_id`, `name`, etc. either:
  (a) imports one of the sanitiser helpers in the same function, OR
  (b) is explicitly listed in `KNOWN_SAFE` below (e.g. internal-only,
      no user input, or sanitised through another mechanism).

Failing this test means a new endpoint was added without an audited
sanitiser — fix the endpoint, don't bypass the test."""
